* Create GitHub Pages:
GitHub Pages is easy for websites for you and your projects. GitHub Pages is hosted directly from your GitHub repository.Just edit, push, and your changes are live.
Tutorial of how to create studying notes pages hosted on GitHub Pages.

** Create a repository
Head over to Github and create a new repository named username.github.io, where username is your username on Github.

** Clone the repository
Go to the folder where you want to store your project, and clone the new repository:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/username/username.github.io
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

** Create folder structure
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

- Creation and conversion
=C-c |=     (org-table-create-or-convert-from-region)
Convert the active region to a table. If every line contains at least one TAB character, the function assumes that the material is tab separated. If every line contains a comma, comma-separated values (CSV) are assumed. If not, lines are split at whitespace into fields. You can use a prefix argument to force a specific separator: C-u forces CSV, C-u C-u forces TAB, C-u C-u C-u will prompt for a regular expression to match the separator, and a numeric argument N indicates that at least N consecutive spaces, or alternatively a TAB will be the separator.

=M-<RET>=     (org-insert-heading)
Insert a new heading/item with the same level as the one at point.
If the command is used at the beginning of a line, and if there is a heading or a plain list item (see Plain lists) at point, the new heading/item is created before the current line. When used at the beginning of a regular line of text, turn that line into a heading.

When this command is used in the middle of a line, the line is split and the rest of the line becomes the new item or headline. If you do not want the line to be split, customize org-M-RET-may-split-line.

Calling the command with a C-u prefix unconditionally inserts a new heading at the end of the current subtree, thus preserving its contents. With a double C-u C-u prefix, the new heading is created at the end of the parent subtree instead.


=C-<RET>=     (org-insert-heading-respect-content)
Insert a new heading at the end of the current subtree.

=M-S-<RET>=     (org-insert-todo-heading)
Insert new TODO entry with same level as current heading. See also the variable org-treat-insert-todo-heading-as-state-change.

=C-S-<RET>=     (org-insert-todo-heading-respect-content)
Insert new TODO entry with same level as current heading. Like C-<RET>, the new headline will be inserted after the current subtree.

=<TAB>=     (org-cycle)
In a new entry with no text yet, the first <TAB> demotes the entry to become a child of the previous one. The next <TAB> makes it a parent, and so on, all the way to top level. Yet another <TAB>, and you are back to the initial level.

=M-<left>=     (org-do-promote)
Promote current heading by one level.

=M-<right>=     (org-do-demote)
Demote current heading by one level.

=M-S-<left>=     (org-promote-subtree)
Promote the current subtree by one level.

=M-S-<right>=     (org-demote-subtree)
Demote the current subtree by one level.

=M-S-<up>=     (org-move-subtree-up)
Move subtree up (swap with previous subtree of same level).

=M-S-<down>=     (org-move-subtree-down)
Move subtree down (swap with next subtree of same level).

=M-h=     (org-mark-element)
Mark the element at point. Hitting repeatedly will mark subsequent elements of the one just marked. E.g., hitting <M-h> on a paragraph will mark it, hitting <M-h> immediately again will mark the next one.

=C-c @=     (org-mark-subtree)
Mark the subtree at point. Hitting repeatedly will mark subsequent subtrees of the same level than the marked subtree.

=C-c C-x C-w=     (org-cut-subtree)
Kill subtree, i.e., remove it from buffer but save in kill ring. With a numeric prefix argument N, kill N sequential subtrees.

=C-c C-x M-w=     (org-copy-subtree)
Copy subtree to kill ring. With a numeric prefix argument N, copy the N sequential subtrees.

=C-c C-x C-y=     (org-paste-subtree)
Yank subtree from kill ring. This does modify the level of the subtree to make sure the tree fits in nicely at the yank position. The yank level can also be specified with a numeric prefix argument, or by yanking after a headline marker like ‘****’.

=C-y=     (org-yank)
Depending on the options org-yank-adjusted-subtrees and org-yank-folded-subtrees, Org's internal yank command will paste subtrees folded and in a clever way, using the same command as C-c C-x C-y. With the default settings, no level adjustment will take place, but the yanked tree will be folded unless doing so would swallow text previously visible. Any prefix argument to this command will force a normal yank to be executed, with the prefix passed along. A good way to force a normal yank is C-u C-y. If you use yank-pop after a yank, it will yank previous kill items plainly, without adjustment and folding.

=C-c C-x c=     (org-clone-subtree-with-time-shift)
Clone a subtree by making a number of sibling copies of it. You will be prompted for the number of copies to make, and you can also specify if any timestamps in the entry should be shifted. This can be useful, for example, to create a number of tasks related to a series of lectures to prepare. For more details, see the docstring of the command org-clone-subtree-with-time-shift.

=C-c C-w=     (org-refile)
Refile entry or region to a different location. See Refile and copy.

=C-c ^=     (org-sort)
Sort same-level entries. When there is an active region, all entries in the region will be sorted. Otherwise the children of the current headline are sorted. The command prompts for the sorting method, which can be alphabetically, numerically, by time (first timestamp with active preferred, creation time, scheduled time, deadline time), by priority, by TODO keyword (in the sequence the keywords have been defined in the setup) or by the value of a property. Reverse sorting is possible as well. You can also supply your own function to extract the sorting key. With a C-u prefix, sorting will be case-sensitive.

=C-x n s=     (org-narrow-to-subtree)
Narrow buffer to current subtree.

=C-x n b=     (org-narrow-to-block)
Narrow buffer to current block.

=C-x n w=     (widen)
Widen buffer to remove narrowing.

=C-c *=     (org-toggle-heading)
Turn a normal line or plain list item into a headline (so that it becomes a subheading at its location). Also turn a headline into a normal line by removing the stars. If there is an active region, turn all lines in the region into headlines. If the first line in the region was an item, turn only the item lines into headlines. Finally, if the first line is a headline, remove the stars from all headlines in the region.

=M-c= capitalize the first letter of the word.

=M-u= Uppercase for the whole word.

=M-d= delete the whole word.

=C-x C-u= upcase-region.

=c-x C-d= downcase-region.

** setting tags:
Tags can simply be typed into the buffer at the end of a headline. After a colon, M-TAB offers completion on tags. There is also a special command for inserting tags:

=C-c C-q=
Enter new tags for the current headline. Org mode will either offer completion or a special single-key interface for setting tags, see below. After pressing RET, the tags will be inserted and aligned to org-tags-column. When called with a C-u prefix, all tags in the current buffer will be aligned to that column, just to make things look nice.

=C-c C-c=
When the cursor is in a headline, this does the same as C-c C-q.

Each major section of this document is defined in its own file.

You can jump to each file by moving the cursor on an "#+include" line
and typing =C-c '= Note: There is *no requirement* to split, but large
org-mode files can become quite slow to edit, so separate sections help
keeping things fluid...
